# JMS Interface

JMS interface type defines the ability to connect to JMS Queue or Topic by any JMS provider (for example, RabbitMQ or Active MQ) which is used by the [Broadway Pub / Sub Actors](/articles/19_Broadway/actors/05_db_actors.md).

To create a new JMS interface:

1. Go to **Project Tree** > **Shared Objects**, right click **Interfaces** and select **New Interface** and then select the **JMS** Interface Type to open the **New Interface** window.
