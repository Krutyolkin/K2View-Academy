# Debug Table Population

A [**Table Population**](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/07_table_population/01_table_population_overview.md) is a Fabric Studio component that defines and executes the mapping and data[ transformation rules](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/07_table_population/05_table_population_mode.md) from a data source, like a DB table or Input file, into a target [Logical Unit (LU) Table.](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/03_logical_units/01_LU_overview.md) 

The Table Population window is used to define and display the transformation rules that are applied to data when it is loaded into a Fabric database.\
The following is an example of the [Table Population window.]

The Population window has a **Debug** option that can be used to execute a Table Population in a Debug mode. The mapped data is displayed in the Population Window working area and errors, if they exist, are displayed in the [Log window](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/13_LUDB_viewer_and_studio_debug_capabilities/02_fabric_studio_log_files.md). 

The Debug process either runs an existing LUDB file which has been generated by the [Data Viewer](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/13_LUDB_viewer_and_studio_debug_capabilities/01_data_viewer.md) or generates a new LUDB file. In the Table Population a source object can return one or many records whereby each output record is mapped and populated into a target LU Table. A Debug process can be executed on each record in the population.

### How do I Use the Debug Toolbar?

The **Debug Toolbar** is used to test the Table Population map by executing its population logic on a selected [Instance ID](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md).
* When the execution is successful, the values of the Input and Output fields are displayed in the working area above the connection lines between the source and the target. 
* If there is an error, it is displayed in the Fabric Studio [Server Log](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/13_LUDB_viewer_and_studio_debug_capabilities/03_debug_table_population.md) section.

The **Debug Toolbar** has the following icons:
