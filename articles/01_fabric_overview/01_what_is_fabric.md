# What is Fabric?
2
​
3
Fabric is a data management platform that provides access to data where and when you need it. 
4
Fabric solves real-time operational needs for data that is stored and handled in different systems, technologies, or geo-locations. 
5
​
6
Acting as a new data layer above existing data sources, Fabric controls data using a patented Digital Entity centric approach offering multiple and diverse built-in integrated data-management capabilities for end-to-end management of the data life cycle.

### What is a Digital Entity?
13
A Digital Entity is a digital version of a person, place or thing and is usually correlated to a business entity like a customer, order, patient, product or household. Once implemented, Fabric creates a micro-data-lake  physical database for each Digital Entity instance.

### Key Fabric Features
16
* Modern and distributed architecture that **provides linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance** on commodity hardware and cloud infrastructure.
17
* Data replication capabilities across nodes and datacenters that **provide customers with the peace of mind of knowing they can survive node failures or regional outages**.
18
* Patented Digital Entity based micro-database, a data lake for each Digital Entity instance that **provides unparalleled performance with standard (ANSI) SQL queries**.
19
* Patented data security approach, every micro-database is encrypted individually, **providing the peace of mind that massive data breaches are prevented**.
20
* Unique near-data-logic architecture that **enfkjdslkdjsfables millisecond performance and throughput for APIs**. 
21
* Built-in integrated drag-n-drop data management capabilities to enable a **time-to-market that is measured in days to weeks and not weeks to months**.
