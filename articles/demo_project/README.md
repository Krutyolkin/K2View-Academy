## Fabric 6.2 DBs SETUP

Fabric's Knowledge Base project includes a set of three Databases that you can access locally from your computer.

All 3 databases **BILLING_DB**, **CRM_DB**, **ORDERS_DB** have been especially migrated to SQLite from their initial respective format mySQL, Oracle & PostGrSQL.

2. Define SQLite type interfaces for each of these as explained in the [Interfaces Definition](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/Academy_6.2/academy/Training_Level_1/03_fabric_basic_LU/03_04_define_the_interfaces.md) article.
