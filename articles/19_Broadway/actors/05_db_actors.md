# DB Commands Actors 

Broadway has a **db** category of Actors that are useful for performing DB commands and actions like creating a new table, loading data or fetching it and executing other DB commands. These Actors are:
- **DbLoad** Actor, loads data into a database using an INSERT, UPDATE or UPSERT command.
- **DbCommand** Actor, performs database commands against a DB interface. It has two extensions: 
  - **DbFetchField** Actor, returns the first field of the first row or null if not present.
  - **DbFetchFirstRow** Actor, returns the first row or an empty row if no result is present.
- **DbCreateTable** Actor, creates a new database table.

Each Actor in the **db** category requires an **interface** input argument that can be defined either as a reference to the Fabric [DB Interface](/articles/05_DB_interfaces/03_DB_interfaces_overview.md) or as a JDBC URL. 

The query defined in the Actor can contain either ordered parameters using **?** or named parameters using **${}** notation. The values of named parameters are taken from the Actor's input parameters or from the **params** input argument and only if it is a map. For ordered parameters, the **params** input argument should be an array or a single value (not a map).

### How Can I Load the Data?

Data can be loaded in a Broadway flow using either a **DbLoad** Actor or a **DbCommand** Actor.

To load the data use the **DbLoad** Actor by populating the Actor's input arguments as follows:

* **command**, select INSERT, UPDATE or UPSERT from the dropdown list.
* **schema**, **table**, either type it in or click the **DB** button to select it from the DB Table Selection popup. 
* **fields, keys**, if a table has been selected, the fields and keys are automatically populated from the DB schema. If not, type in the field names.

Another way to load the data in a Broadway flow is by using the **DbCommand** Actor and writing the SQL INSERT statement in the **sql** input argument. The values to be populated in the table can be taken from the input arguments using the named parameters. For example:

â€‹	`INSERT INTO DATA (TEXT) VALUES (${text} )`

Where **${text}** is replaced with the value of the **text** input argument in the prepared statement.

### DB Commands Examples
### Examples
The **db-commands.flow** example shows how the **DbCommand** Actor can be used to perform various DB actions, including:

* Creating a table using the SQL provided in the **sql** input argument.
* Inserting the data into the table using the **sql** input argument with named parameters marked as **${text}**. The parameter's values are populated from the **params** input argument.
* Selecting the data from the table using the **sql** input argument with an ordered parameter marked as **?**.

**Example of Passing Parameters to SQL**

The following example shows how to execute a SELECT statement which includes a WHERE clause using **ordered params**:

![image](../images/99_actors_05_2.png)

The parameters for the WHERE clause are transferred using the **Const** Actor's [values] object that is connected to the **params** input argument of the **DbCommand** Actor.

  "Denver",
  "CO"

The following example shows how to execute a SELECT statement using **named params**:

When the above query is written in the **sql** input parameter, a new **city_name** input argument is added to the **DbCommand** Actor and the parameter is transferred to it.
