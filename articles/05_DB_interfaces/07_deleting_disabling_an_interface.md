Deleting / Disabling an Interface

A database interface can be deleted from Fabric when it becomes irrelevant.

How do I Delete an Interface?

1.	Go to the **Project Tree**, click **Shared Objects** and then click **Interfaces** to open the Interfaces list.
2.	Right click the **Interface** and click **Delete Selected Items**.

Note that for the changes to become effective for the Fabric object (for example for Web Services or an LU), deploy each object to the server separately.
