# Editing Interface Settings

Throughout a Projectâ€™s lifecycle there are a number of reasons for modifying, disabling or deleting interface settings. For example, to update an IP address or the credentials of a DB you wish to access as a data source.

### How Do I Change an Interface's Connection Settings?

1.	Go to the **Project Tree**, click **Shared Objects** and then click **Interfaces** to open the Interfaces list.
2.	Double click the **interface** to open it.
3.	Edit the [**Connection Settings**](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/05_DB_interfaces/03_DB_interfaces_overview.md).
4.	To verify that the new settings are valid, click the [**Test Connection**](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/05_DB_interfaces/04_creating_a_new_database_interface.md) link.  
5.	**Save** the interface. 

Note that for the changes to become effective for the Fabric object (for example for Web Services or an LU), deploy each object to the server separately.
