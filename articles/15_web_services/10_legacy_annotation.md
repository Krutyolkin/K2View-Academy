# Legacy Annotation

The functionality of full alignment with RESTFUL web services standards was introduced from Fabric release 5.5. In order to provide a backwards compatibility for the existing projects that are looking for upgrade but insist to preserve the existing web services response, it is possible to add @legacy annotation on category level (can be edited by notepad or intelliJ). Meaning that all web services under the category marked with @legacy annotation will response with older structure. 

Any new web service defined under the same category will align the web-service response structure accordingly.
