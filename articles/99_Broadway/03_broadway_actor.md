# Broadway Actor

## Actor Overview

A Broadway  **Actor** represents an action that is executed on a [Stage](/articles/99_Broadway/19_broadway_flow_stages.md) of the [Broadway flow](/articles/99_Broadway/16_broadway_flow_overview.md) to get input parameters and return output parameters. For example, reading a file, creating a table, parsing an object or concatenating a string.

Broadway offers a number of [built-in Actors](/articles/99_Broadway/04_built_in_actor_types.md) which address a wide range of predefined activities and can be added to Broadway flows. 

When there is requirement to execute business logic that is not supported by a built-in Actor, a **JavaScript** Actor that executes JavaScript provided in the **Script** [Input parameter](/articles/99_Broadway/03_broadway_actor_window.md#data-input-parameters) can be used. 

Options for working with Actors include:
- [Adding Actors to the Stages](/articles/99_Broadway/03_broadway_actor.md#how-do-i-add-actor-to-stage) of a Broadway flow.
- [Saving a flow as an Actor](/articles/99_Broadway/03_broadway_actor.md#how-do-i-save-flow-as-actor) to be used as inner flow of other Broadway flows.
- [Exporting Actors](/articles/99_Broadway/03_broadway_actor.md#how-do-i-export-an-actor) to create inherited Actors with extended business logic.  

### How Do I Add Actor to Stage?

To add an Actor to Stage in a Broadway flow:
1.  Click anywhere in the **Stage** area to open the **Add Actors to [Stage Name]** window which displays a list of categories on the left and the built-in Actors of each categories on the right. 
2.  Click **SUBMIT** to finish the action and add the Actor to the Stage.

### How Do I Save a Flow as an Actor?

There are scenarios where you may prefer to package a flow and then use it as an inner flow in another flow to avoid complex flows with many steps. This enables reusing business logic in different flows. For example, defining an inner flow that handles errors.  

To save a flow as an Actor:

Click **Actions** > **Save as Actor** in the Main menu of [Broadway flow window](/articles/99_Broadway/18_broadway_flow_window.md#main-menu). The newly created Actor type can be added to other flows.

### How Do I Export an Actor?

An Actor object can be exported to create an Actor Type based on this object which can then be reused. 

During the Export process the new Actor type inherits the current Actor and is then added to the list of built-in Actors and can be used in other flows.

To export an Actor:

Click **Export Actor** in the [Actor's context menu](/articles/99_Broadway/18_broadway_flow_window.md#actors-context-menu).

## Actor Description and Remarks

The description of the Actor is read-only and is generated by the Product. A remark is a user's comment added during the flow implementation.
Note that when exporting an Actor, the Actor's remarks are copied to the description of the new Actor type.

Click ![image](/articles/99_Broadway/images/99_19_dots.PNG) in the right corner of the Actor to open the [Actor's context menu](/articles/99_Broadway/18_broadway_flow_window.md#actors-context-menu) and select **Description** to view the description of the Actor type. The Description window is displayed in a read-only mode. See the foolowing example:
