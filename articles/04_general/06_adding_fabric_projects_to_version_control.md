# Adding Fabric Projects to Version Control

### Fabric Version Control Overview

The Fabric Studio has a built-in Version Control functionality based on GIT standards. The benefits of using Versioning Control are:

* Maintaining current and historical versions of files.
* Cooperative and simultaneous work of multiple users while ensuring the integrity of their work. 
* Reverting to an older version of a projectâ€™s files when errors are found in a current version.

Note that although there is an option for working with Apache Sub-version (SVN), it is recommended to work in a GIT framework

### How do I Start Working with Version Control?
 
To start using Configuration Control, do either:

* Create a new project and add the project to version control.
* Check out an existing project based on the repository type: GIT or SVN.

Each user can work on a local copy of the project that is synchronized with the central repository of the project. Synchronization is performed manually.\
Note that if you choose to work with SVN as your preferred version control, the K2Admin Studio should be installed in order to define the repository, users, groups and permissions.

### Project Tree Version Control Indicators

When a project is registered in the Version Control system, the following indicators may be displayed next to the Project Tree components based on their status:
