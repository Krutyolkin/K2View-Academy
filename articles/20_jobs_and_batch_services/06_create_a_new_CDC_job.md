# How Do I Create a New CDC Job?

## Purpose
Fabric can execute [CDC](/articles/18_cdc_and_search/02_cdc_messages.md) Jobs (Change Data Capture) to notify external systems about any data changes occuring in Fabric DB. 
Jobs can also execute cross-instance searches using Fabric's Search capability - (Elastic Search command syntax should be used).

Set the **Job** type to **cdc_republish_instance_job**

## Example:
``` startjob cdc_republish_instance_job Customer.1000 tables='customer,address'```
