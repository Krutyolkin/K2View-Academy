# **Fabric Jobs Overview** 

Fabric supplies a rich, resilient, and scalable built-in functionality that allows the system to run any script or other executable using the Fabric Jobs mechanism.

Fabric Jobs fall into one of the following categories:

- User Jobs
The ability to run light weight user functions.

- Process Jobs
The ability to run a script or any other executable using the jobs mechanism.

- Migrate process
The ability to sync multiple instances of a particular Logical Unit.

- Parsers executions
Parsers allow you to get data from both tables and unstructured files. Using Fabric parser capacities, data can be pushed to a table in Cassandra, and then use this table when building a LUT schema.

- Broadway Flows
Broadway flows can be scheduled for execution and therefore defined as jobs.


In this section we will see :
- the different types of jobs
- their mechanism and lifecycle
- how to define them from both Fabric Studio
- invoke and manage them from Fabric Runtime console.
