# **Fabric Batch Processes Architecture**

## **Fabric Batch Processes Flow**  

The following activities are automatically triggered when a new Batch process is executed:
-  A new entry is added in Cassandra under the k2viewsystem keyspace in the Batch table.
-  A new Job entry is recorded in the k2viewsystem.jobs table with the following parameters:
   
   -  Name = the name of the Batch process.
   
   -  Type = BATCH PROCESS.
-  The Batch process is assigned a WAITING_FOR_JOB status.  

After this, any available node, or any node whose affinity has been specified in the Batch command, handles the execution of the Job and of the subcommand as specified in the Batch command.

Once the corresponding Job begins, and is set to an **IN_PROCESS** stage, the Batch process undergoes the following stages:
1. NEW
2. GENERATE_IID
3. IN_PROGRESS
4. FAILED/CANCELLED/DONE

The illustration below shows how, once triggered from the command line, a batch process is automatically encapsulated into a Job process. In turn, the Job Process launches the batch command that then, runs through its lifecycle phases.

## **Scheduling Batch Processes**

To schedule a Batch process to be executed either at a given time or recurrently, a scheduled Job process must be created with a script containing the batch command to be repeatedly invoked. This consists of creating a Job that calls a Batch process which in turn creates multiple or scheduled one-time Jobs with the execution parameters parsed in the Batch command.

## **Batch Process Table in Cassandra**
All batch-related information is displayed in the **k2batchprocess** keyspace in the **batchprocess_list** table.

### Example 

```
cassandra@cqlsh:k2batchprocess> select * from batchprocess_list;

 bid | arguments | command | creation_time | end_time | error | extra_stats | lut_name | owner | start_time | status | total_entities
-----+-----------+---------+---------------+----------+-------+-------------+----------+-------+------------+--------+----------------

```

**Arguments**  

      {"AUTH_TOKEN":"ws","FABRIC_COMMAND":"sync_instance AUTODATA_DELTA.?","JOB_UID":"BATCH AUTODATA_DELTA FROM idsFile USING ('select id from ids  limit 100') FABRIC_COMMAND=\"sync_instance AUTODATA_DELTA.?\" with async=trub9c7eb\",\"LOG_ID\":\"1000000000072\"}","SRC_DB_INTERFACE_NAME":"idsFile","AUTH_USER":"","sync_mode":"ON","INSTANCES_LIST":"","lu_name":"AUTODATA_DELTA","COMMAND":"BATCH AUTODATA_DELTA FROM idsFile USING ('select id from ids  limit 100') FABRIC_COMMAND=\"syn_Delta","SRC_DB_QUERY":"select id from ids  limit 100","environment_name":"_dev"}

**Command**  

```BATCH AUTODATA_DELTA FROM idsFile USING ('select id from ids  limit 100') FABRIC_COMMAND="sync_instance AUTODATA_DELTA.?" with JOB_AFFINITY='10.21.2.102' ASYNC='true';```

- in this case a synchronization process of a list of IDs with affinity set to Node: 10.21.2.102 



**extra_stats**  

This field shows the slowest-processed entities, along with their ID, processing time, status, and fields changes: 

```{"slowestProcessed":[{"entityId":"4","processTimeMS":572,"status":"COMPLETED","result":"{\"Added\":1,\"Updated\":0,\"Unchanged\":0}"},{"entityId":"5","processTimeMS":573,"status":"COMPLETED","result":"{\"Added\":1,\"Updated\":0,\"Unchanged\":0}"},{"entityId":"47","processTimeMS":645,"status":"COMPLETED","result":"{\"Added\":1,\"Updated\":0,\"Unchanged\":0}"}```



### **Batch Tables and Job Tables Correlation in Cassandra**
Information about the Job created during the execution of the Batch process is displayed in the **k2system** keyspace in the **k2_jobs** table.

**Example** 

The previous Batch process is displayed in the Job's table. Its **output** field can be cross-referenced with the **bid** field in the Batch table with:

### **Migrate Tables in Cassandra**
All migrate-related information is displayed in the **k2migrate.migration_list** and **k2migrate.migration_iid_info** tables in Cassandra's **k2migrate** keyspace.



## **Batch Process Execution & Resiliency**


When executed asynchrounously (*async* flag set to *true*), the batch process inherits from the Jobs ability to transfer the process to a different node when a node is no longer active or no longer responding. This handover mechanism uses the [*hearbeats*](/articles/20_jobs_and_batch_services/06_jobs_configuration.md#heartbeat) and [*keepalive*](/articles/20_jobs_and_batch_services/06_jobs_configuration.md#keepalive) parameters defined within the node.id file.

The next handling node picks up the batch process (via its associated job) and resumes its execution from the latest known recorded stage.   

Each Fabric node uses its Fabric built-in BatchProcessAPI and [Job Manager](/articles/20_jobs_and_batch_services/02_jobs_flow_and_status.md#jobs-logic) classes to manage the Batch process through its different lifecycle stages, as defined in the illustrations above.
