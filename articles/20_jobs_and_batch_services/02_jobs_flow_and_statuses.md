# **Fabric Jobs Flow** 

A job's flow consists of the following stages: DEFINE, CONFIGURE and DEPLOY
- DEFINE: a function needs to be defined as a job function under a specific LU - it needs to be defined and attached to a specific LU type under the LU Utilities folder.
- CONFIGURE: a new job entry must be added to the jobs'table that features under the LU Type tree, with a number of configuration parameters and a method, which is basically one of the functions previosuly defined as a job function
- DEPLOY: the LU, its associated job functions and the jobs table are processed by the the Fabric Node onto which the deployment was performed. The job will happen
