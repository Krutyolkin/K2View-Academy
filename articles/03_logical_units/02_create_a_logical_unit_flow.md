# Create a Logical Unit Flow 

The LU Schema creation process can be initiated using K2View’s [Auto-Discovery](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/03_logical_units/06_auto_discovery_wizard.md)  module or performed manually using K2View’s drag-and-drop graphical user interface, K2View Fabric Studio. 

Creating a Logical Unit involves several steps. The following is an overview of the main steps :

You can also duplicate an LU in your project and save it as a new LU:
1. Right click the **Logical Unit** > **Duplicate Logical Unit**.
1. Enter a name for the new (duplicated) **Logical Unit** in the **Name** field.
