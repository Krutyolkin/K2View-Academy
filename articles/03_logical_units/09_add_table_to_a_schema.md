# Editing and Adding a Table to an LU Schema

An [LU Table](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/02_LU_tables/01_LU_tables_overview.md)  is a basic building block in a Logical Unit (LU).

To add a table to an LU Schema, do either: 

1. Use the [Auto Discovery Wizard](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/03_logical_units/06_auto_discovery_wizard.md) to create or edit an LU whereby the tables and their populations are automatically created and added to the LU schema.
2. Drag a **DB Table** into the **LU Schema** window:\
   a. Go to the [DB Objects tab](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/03_logical_units/03_LU_schema_window.md#logical-unit-lu-tabs) of the [LU Schema](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/03_logical_units/03_LU_schema_window.md). \
   b. Click **DB Connection** and then click the [**DB interface**](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/05_DB_interfaces/01_interfaces_overview.md).\
   c. Click the **Tables** and then drag them into the **LU Schema**. You can drag several tables.\
   d. Check either: 
    * **Create Table Based DB Query.**
    * **Create Table Based Root Function.**

The selected tables are automatically created with the selected type of population and added to the LU schema.

3. Drag a **Table** into the LU **Schema window**:\
    a. Go to the [Objects tab](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/03_logical_units/03_LU_schema_window.md#logical-unit-lu-tabs) of the [LU Schema](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/03_logical_units/03_LU_schema_window.md).\
    b. Select a **Table** and drag it into the **LU Schema** window.

4. Right click the **Schema** window and select one of the following options:\
    a. **New Table from SQL Based DB Query.**\
    b. **New Table from SQL Based Root Function**.\
Both options open the Query Builder. The LU table and its population are automatically generated based on the SQL query defined in the Query Builder.
