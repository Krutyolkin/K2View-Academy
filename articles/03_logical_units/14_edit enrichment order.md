# Edit Enrichment Order

## What is an Enrichment Function?
An Enrichment Function is a Java function without input/output parameters that is used to insert, update or delete an LU table.
* Enrichment Functions are executed after the execution of all population objects of  all LU tables. 
* One or several Enrichment Functions can be attached to each LU Table.

## What is an Enrichment Order?
The execution order of all Enrichment Functions is determined at the LU Schema level in the Enrichment Order tab. Only Enrichment Functions that are directly related to specific   tables are included in the display.

## How Can I Change the Enrichment Order? 
Use the **Up** and **Down** arrows in the **Enrichment Order** tab of the [**LU schema**](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/wiki/Logical-Unit-Schema-Window) to change the execution order of its Enrichment functions.
