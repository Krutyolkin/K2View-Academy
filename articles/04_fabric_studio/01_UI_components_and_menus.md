### What is the Fabric Studio User Interface?
Fabric Studio is a designer tool that manages the construction of [Digital Entities](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md#digital-entity). As an integrated tool, Fabric allows you to implement mapping rules into a Project and to deploy your implementation to the Fabric Server.

Built over a Windows-based platform, Fabric Studio offers a user friendly look-and-feel development environment known as the Implementation Layer. Each Project is initiated and maintained through this platform and working space.\
As an integrated tool, Fabric Studio allows you to:
* Design [Digital Entities](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md#digital-entity) and their associated [Logical Units (LUs)](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/03_logical_units/01_LU_overview.md).
* Use robust ETL options to define the mapping logic on each LU Table using various transformation objects like [Functions](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/07_table_population/08_project_functions.md), [Globals](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/08_globals/01_globals_overview.md) or [Translations](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/09_translations/01_translations_overview_and_use_cases.md).
* Deploy a [Fabric Project](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/04_fabric_studio/05_creating_a_new_project.md) or selected components of a Project to the Fabric runtime environment. 
* [Debug and view](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/13_LUDB_viewer_and_studio_debug_capabilities/01_data_viewer.md) mapped data, data flow and data exposure. 

Fabric Studio also enables you to integrate your Projects into Source Version Control systems based on Git or the Apache Sub-version (SVN) Standard.

The Start Page has links to different K2View Fabric Projects, including: 
* Start a new Project, with or without configuration control. 
* Open an existing Project.
* Checkout a Project from the configuration control.
* Quick links to recently opened projects. 
* Help and User Guide. 

[Click for more information about Creating a New Project.](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/04_fabric_studio/05_creating_a_new_project.md)

Click the K2View icon on the top left corner of the Studio to restore, move, size, minimize, maximize or close the Fabric Studio.

### What are the File Tab Options?
The File tab has the following options:
* New Project. 
* Open Project. 
* Checkout Project (from SVN or Git repository). 
* Close Project. 
* Recent Projects.

### New Item Tab Options
Click **New Item** to open a **New Item** under a selected **LU** or Shared **Objects**:
* Select a **LU** from the current **Logical Unit** dropdown list to create the new item under the selected **LU**. For example, a new [Function](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/07_table_population/09_creating_an_LUDB_function.md), [LU Table,](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/06_LU_tables/01_LU_tables_overview.md) [Interface](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/05_DB_interfaces/01_interfaces_overview.md) or [Global](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/08_globals/01_globals_overview.md).
* To create a new item under [Shared Objects](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/04_fabric_studio/12_shared_objects.md), the current Logical Unit dropdown list should be blank.

Note that this area allows you to open a new item only for LU or Shared Objects. 

### What are the Main Elements of the Project Tree? 
The Project Tree displays the components of the current Project as a hierarchy of entities. The main elements of the hierarchy include:
* Project, the top-level of the hierarchy. Each Project has the following branches (sub-objects): 
  * [Shared Objects](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/04_fabric_studio/12_shared_objects.md) used by all Logical Units and Project references and may include a sub-hierarchy, as follows:
    * Globals. 
    * Environments. 
    * Database types. 
    * Interfaces. 
    * Functions. 
    * Java, Java files and resource files. 
    * Translations. 
* _References_, reference information that may be used throughout the instance. 
* Web Services, a collection of all functions that are defined as Web Services for this Project.
* [Logical Units](https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/master/articles/03_logical_units/01_LU_overview.md), a collection of all Logical Units defined in the Project.

**Note:** All operations performed in the Project Treeâ€™s options are accessible from the context menus of the different components in the Project Tree. For example, creating a new function is accessed from the context menu when you right click the Functions object in the Project Tree.
