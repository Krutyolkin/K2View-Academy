# Fabric Runtime Overview

Well Done! You have just completed an overall  fabric main flow quiz as well as a basic project implementation. You have completed the previous learning item, with the deployment of your project to fabric server. 

As previously covered, Fabric consists of two distinct layers:

- Implementation Layer (Studio): the design, development, definition of tables and transformation rules and deployment are performed.
- Execution Layer (Server): the actual migration and synchronization of data from the source systems to  Fabric is performed in this environment.



Let's understand how the rules and logic created as part of your project implementation , are being deployed to the execution layer , while the data is being stored, accessed and queried on demand.
