# Fabric Runtime Overview

Well Done! 

You have just completed the Fabric Main Flow Quiz as well as a basic project implementation. You have also completed the previous learning item by deploying your project to the Fabric server. 

As previously covered, Fabric consists of two separate layers:

- Implementation Layer (Studio): where the design, development, definition of tables and transformation rules and deployment are performed.
- Execution Layer (Server): where the actual migration and synchronization of data from source systems into  Fabric is performed.



Let's see how the rules and logic created as part of your project implementation are deployed to the Execution layer, while data is  stored, accessed and queried on demand.



### What Will You Experience in this Learning Item?

By the end of the Fabric Runtime learning item you will know:

- The Fabric server main directories and basic utilities
- Fabric main configuration files
- Fabric  basic commands 
- Cassandra main keyspaces and commands
