# Course Overview

Welcome to your very first Fabric course! Our goal, at K2View, is to provide you with the means essential to kick-start your first projects while giving you the means and confidence to explore the many data transformations development tools provided by our framework.

Big data systems, as you already know, are overwhelming;  from both data quantity and data quality perspectives.

Once equipped with Fabric, you will know how to connect to multiple types and formats of data sources; these being of any size, of any type of structure (if any at all), and of any purpose (whether legacy or real-time). 

You will then learn how to manipulate the data you are sourcing into your Fabric environment, how to create new data relationships and therefore generate the unique-value information you could not harness beforehand. 

Once this is done, you will be shown how to expose this data through a set of customized APIs to external parties such as your colleagues, customers, partners, etc..

 

To fully understand this course, you should be familiar with the following principles, development languages and tools:

\-     Relational (such as MySQL, SQLite)

\-     Non-relational Databases (Cassandra type) 

\-     Java, SQL & CQL

\-     Git or any other versioning control tools

 

All along the course, we will evolve within a Telco customer management environment that provides a set of DBs and tables that you will use to operate your first fabric-based queries and data manipulations. 

This work environment will feature the usual set of tables that you are already familiar with, such as customers, subscribers, invoices, contracts, and so forth. We will explore these in more details later during the course.

 

But first, let’s understand what Fabric is about:
