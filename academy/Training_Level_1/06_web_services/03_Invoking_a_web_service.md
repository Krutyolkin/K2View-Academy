# Invoking a Web Service

Now that you have created and deployed you first Web Service into Fabric,  you can see the data by invoking it from the Fabric Studio or by using any API client. Since Fabric's Web Services comply with REST API  guidelines, it is fully integrated with the latest Open API platform - **Swagger**.

### Invoking and Testing Web Services

Let's learn how to invoke and test a Web Service from the Fabric Studio using Swagger:

[Swagger](/articles/15_web_services/09_swagger.md)

To ensure that the data being exposed by the Web Service is secured, authenticated and executed with permissions, set the Web Service credentials as follows:	

[Fabric Credentials Commands](/articles/17_fabric_credentials/02_fabric_credentials_commands.md)

### ![](/academy/Training_Level_1/03_fabric_basic_LU/images/example.png) Example - Invoking a Web Service

1. Right click the **Web Service** that you created and select **Invoke Web Service**.
2. Choose the prefered environent from context menu: The Fabric server name or Local Fabric (debug).
   Swagger is prompted and the invoked Web Service is expanded. Note that since the defined **Verb** for the Web Service included all options: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, All of these options are available. The GET (default) option is expanded.
3. Click **Try it out**, set the **i_id** to **82** and execute. 
   What is the response? `"Failed to authorize"` 
   Why? `The Web Service is requiring a token for authentication` 
4. For the request to succeed, create the permissions and a token:
   1. `create user 'test_user';`
   2. `create role 'admin';`
   3. `grant ALL_WS on * to 'admin';`
   4. `assign role 'admin' to user 'test_user';`
   5. `Create token test;`
   6. `assign role 'admin' to token test;`
5. Let's go back and try to execute the Web Service again, Click the **Lock**, set a valid **Token** and close.
7. Set the **i_id** to **82** and execute. 
   What is the Customer's first name? `Anthony`

Using the training materials and examples covered so far:

1. `Create a new version for **wsGetCustomer** which will enhance the current functionality:`

   1. `Return the Customer's details icluding their contracts and associated subscribers. The reponse should returned based on SUBSCRIBER.VIP_STATUS. Only the Customer full name should appear as part of the response` 

      **Note**, make sure the WS path is the same for both Web Services.

2. `Question: What is the SSN of Customer 1?`

3. `Question: How many subscribers has Customer 1 with VIP_STATUS "Platinum"?`

4. `Question: What is the CONTRACT_DESCRIPTION of the Subscriber with VIP_STATUS "Silver" ?`

5. `Question: Which version of you Web Service will be executed if the version is not set?`
