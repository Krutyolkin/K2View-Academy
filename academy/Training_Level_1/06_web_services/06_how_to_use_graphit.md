# Working with Graphit

Graphit is a utility that allows you to design the documents response format of your web-services.

### Creating and Editing a graphit file

The following are the basic steps for creating a Graphit file and understanding its structure and properties:

-  [Create and Edit a Graphit File](/articles/15_web_services/17_Graphit/02_create_and_edit_a_graphit_file.md)


The following articles desscribe the different types of Graphit Nodes and their properties:

-  [Graphit Nodes Properties](/articles/15_web_services/17_Graphit/04_graphit_node_properties.md)


Running Graphit:
- In debug mode from the Graphit Editor: [Graphit Debugging](/articles/15_web_services/17_Graphit/05_graphit_debugging.md)
- [Using Graphit with Parameters](/articles/15_web_services/17_Graphit/06_using_graphit_files_with_parameters.md)

**Exercise 1 - Create a Graphit web-service**
  
For this exercise we will be referring to the exercise from previous section: [LU Enhancements - Translations](/master/academy/Training_Level_1/05_LU_Enhancements/04_LU_Enhancements_lookup-translations_flow.md).
There, we associated a unique geo-location code to the Address table to build a heat map of the customer's location.
 
            Step 1: 
            Open the CustomerLU address table
