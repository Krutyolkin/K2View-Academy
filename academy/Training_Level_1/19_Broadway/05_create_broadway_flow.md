# Create, Run and Debug a Broadway Flow 

Now you are familiar with Broadway and its main components and have checked out and executed the Broadway Tutorial flow, you are ready to create your first Broadway flow. 


### What Will You Experience In This Learning Item?

By the end of this learning item you will:

- Know how to create a Broadway flow.
- Run and debug a Broadway flow and view the data.

### Broadway Flow Overview

A Broadway flow:

-  Represents a business process that binds other objects into the same flow. 
-  Acts as a graph or a tree that has several [Stages](/articles/19_Broadway/19_broadway_flow_stages.md) where each Stage includes one or more [Actors](/articles/19_Broadway/03_broadway_actor.md). 
-  Stages are executed consecutively from left to right, where the Actors in each Stage of the flow are executed top-down.

A Broadway flow can run with Debug mode ON or OFF. When Debug is ON, breakpoints can be added in order that the flow will stop and the data can be inspected by the Data Viewer that displays the Java objects using a JSON-like visualization of maps, lists and Java primitives.
