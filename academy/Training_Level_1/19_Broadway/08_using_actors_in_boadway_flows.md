# Using Actors in Broadway Flows

### What Will You Experience In This Learning Item?

By the end of this learning item you will:

- Know about the different types of links between Actors.
- Know how to edit input and output arguments and add remarks.
- Be familiar with the most used built-in Actors.

### Actors Overview

Now that you know how to create and run a Broadway flow, let's learn more about Actors and how they can be used in various scenarios.

Broadway Actors represent reusable pieces of logic with input and output arguments that can be assembled together to create complex logic. Actors are executed on a [Stage](/articles/19_Broadway/19_broadway_flow_stages.md) in the [Broadway flow](/articles/19_Broadway/02a_broadway_flow_overview.md). They receive input parameters, execute their action and return output parameters. 

To learn about Broadway Actors, their properties and how to link them in a Broadway flow, please refer to:

* [Actors Overview](/articles/19_Broadway/03_broadway_actor.md).
* [Actor Properties Window](/articles/19_Broadway/03_broadway_actor_window.md).
* [Broadway Data Types](/articles/19_Broadway/05_data_types.md).

Note that Broadway supports additional activities such as Export an Actor or Save a flow as an Actor. These Broadway capabilities are explained later in this training.



Now let's see the example of using Actors in flows, linking them, setting and removing the remarks and changing population types.
