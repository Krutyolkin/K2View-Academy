### ![info](/academy/images/example.png)Example 3 - Transactions

For this example open the flow which you created in the [Using Actors in a Flow](10_using_various_actors_exercise.md)  exercise. We already used a Transaction there but didn't examine how it works.

1. Run the flow and verify that a new entry was added to the ACT_SUM Fabric LU table.
2. Click ![dots](images/three_dots_icon.png)> **Transaction** in the Stage 6 context menu to uncheck the Transaction.
3. Run the flow again and verify that a new entry was not added to the table.
4. Verify the log file to see the message that a rollback was performed.
