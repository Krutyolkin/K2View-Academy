### ![info](/academy/images/example.png)Example 3 - Transactions

To see this example, open the flow you created in the [Using Actors in a Flow](10_using_various_actors_exercise.md) exercise. The flow already has a Transaction that has not yet been examined.

1. Run the flow and verify that a new entry has been added to the ACT_SUM Fabric LU table.
2. Click ![dots](images/three_dots_icon.png)> **Transaction** in the Stage 6 context menu to uncheck the Transaction.
3. Run the flow again and verify that a new entry has not been added to the table.
4. Check the  message in the log file to verify that a rollback has been performed.
