# Broadway Integration with Fabric Studio

### What Will You Experience In This Learning Item?

By the end of this learning item you will:

- Be familiar with the integration points between the Broadway and Fabric Studio.
- Create a Broadway flow for table population.
- Define an Interface Listener for a Broadway flow.

### Overview

The Fabric Studio includes several integration points that are used by Broadway Actors to simplify the creation of Broadway flows such as:

* **Broadway as a Population** - ability to create a flow which can be used to populate one or more tables streamlining the logic and the related validations.
* **Interface Listener for Broadway flows** - ability to define a SFTP or a local file system listener for a Broadway flow.
* **FabricGet** / **FabricSet** Actors to execute Fabric commands.
* **LuFunction** Actor to invoke any LU Project function from the flow.
* **Graphit** Actor to execute Graphit logic for data serialization.

To learn about the described above functionality in more details, please refer to:

* [Table Populations Based on Broadway Flows](/articles/07_table_population/14_table_population_based_Broadway.md).



Now let's do an exercise of creating a Broadway flow as a population.
