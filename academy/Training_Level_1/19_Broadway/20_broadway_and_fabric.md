### What Will You Experience In This Learning Item?

By the end of this learning item you will:

- Be able to invoke a Broadway flow from the Fabric Console.



### Overview

You have learned about the Broadway and its various features accessible via the Fabric Studio. Now let's take a look at how Broadway can be invoked by the Fabric Console. Please refer to the following:

* [Running a Broadway flow as a Job](/articles/20_jobs_and_batch_services/05_create_a_new_broadway_job.md) - the Fabric Jobs mechanism enables running a flow providing the execution parameters (LU name and the flow name).
* [Batch commands](/articles/20_jobs_and_batch_services/15_batch_broadway_commands.md) - ability to run a flow as a batch process providing the batch configuration parameters as well as the execution parameters (LU name and the flow name).
* A Broadway command - ability to run a flow once providing the execution parameters (LU name and the flow name) once the flow has been deployed. If the flow receives external input arguments, they can be sent using the param=value syntax. 
* [Consuming CDC messages by Broadway] => Tali



Now let's see few examples that will demonstrate the above Broadway features.
