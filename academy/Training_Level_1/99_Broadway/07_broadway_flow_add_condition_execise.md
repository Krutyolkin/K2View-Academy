# ![](/academy/images/Exercise.png) Exercise â€“ Adding a Condition to a Broadway Flow 

You have just created and tested your first Broadway flow that selects data from a DB table and creates a JSON file based on the selected DB records. You have also practiced adding Stages and Actors to a Broadway flow and then adding a loop to the flow. 

Now, let's practice another Broadway flow feature - adding conditions to a flow. 


In this exercise you will add a condition to your flow that does the following:

- Checks if the number of selected records >= 3:  

  - If this condition is fulfilled, adds a message to the log file.

  - Else, adds an error message to the log file.

    

Before starting, please read [Broadway Flow - Stages](/articles/19_Broadway/19_broadway_flow_stages.md) to learn about splitting and merging the Stages of a flow and about adding conditions to a Stage. 

#### Step 1 - Open the Broadway Flow
1. Go to the **project tree** > **Shared Objects** > **Broadway** and click the flow you created in the [previous lesson](/academy/Training_Level_1/99_Broadway/05_create_broadway_flow.md).

#### Step 2 - Add Counting of Selected Records

1. Add the **Count** Actor to **Stage 2**. This Actor returns the number of times an Actor is called. When this Actor is added to the loop, it counts the number of selected records.

#### Step 3 - Add a Condition to the Flow

In this Step, you will check if the number of records is >= 3. 

1. Add a new Stage to the flow.

2. Click ![three dots](/academy/Training_Level_1/99_Broadway/images/three_dots_icon.png) in the new Stage and select  **Stage Condition**. A window opens where you can select the Actor and add it to the Stage.

3. Select the **GreaterThanEquals** Actor and click  **SUBMIT**:

     - The **GreaterThanEquals** Actor returns **true** if the value of the **a** parameter is greater than or equals the value of the **b** parameter. This Actor is in grey since it is added in a condition.

     Read [Broadway Actor](/articles/19_Broadway/03_broadway_actor.md), [Broadway Actor's Properties Window](/articles/19_Broadway/03_broadway_actor_window.md), and [Built-In Actor Types](/articles/19_Broadway/04_built_in_actor_types.md) to learn more about Broadway Actors.

4. Link the output of the **Count** condition to the **GreaterThanEquals** **a** input parameter.

5.  Set the **b** input parameter to be a **Const** and set its value to 3.

6. Split **Stage 4** into two forks: one fork to be executed if the **GreaterThanEquals** Actor returns **true** and another fork if the **GreaterThanEquals** returns **false**:

      - Click ![three dots](/academy/Training_Level_1/99_Broadway/images/three_dots_icon.png) in **Stage 4** and select **Split**. 
      - A new **Stage 5** is created on the same level as **Stage 4**.  
      - Click ![three dots](/academy/Training_Level_1/99_Broadway/images/three_dots_icon.png) in the newly created **Stage 5** and select **Else**.

#### Step 4 - Add the Next Stages

1. Add a Stage to the flow and split it into **Stage 6** and **Stage 7**.
2. Add the **Logger** Actors to **Stage 6** and **Stage 7**.
3. Set the **Logger** Actor's parameters of **Stage 6**:
   - Set the **message** input parameter as **Const**.
   - Set the **message** input parameter value to: **There are ${0} records in the list**. The **${0}** is set for the first parameter of the **params** input parameter.
   - Set the **level** input parameter to **info**.
4. Link the **Count** Actor to the **Logger** Actor or to **Stage 6**.
5. Set the **Logger** Actor's parameters of **Stage 7**:
   - Set the **message** input parameter as **Const**.
   
   - Set the **message** input parameter value to **Error- there are not enough records in the list**.
   
   - Set the **level** input parameter to **error**. The condition has been added to your flow:

#### Step 5 - Debug the Updated Flow

1. Click ![Debug Step](/academy/Training_Level_1/99_Broadway/images/debug_step_icon.png) to execute the flow steps in Debug mode:

   <ul>
   <pre><code>
   A. What is the output value of the <strong>Count</strong> Actor? 
   B. What is the output value of the <strong>GreaterThanEquals</strong> Actor? 
   C. Which Stage has been executed - <strong>Stage 6</strong> or <strong>Stage 7</strong>? Why?
   D. Check the output of the <a href="/articles/13_LUDB_viewer_and_studio_debug_capabilities/02_fabric_studio_log_files.md">Fabric Log File</a>. 
      Which message is given by the <strong>Logger</strong> Actor? What is the level of the message? 
   </code></pre>
   </ul>
   
   
2. Update the **GreaterThanEquals** Actor, set the **b** parameter to 10 instead of 3.

3. Rerun the Debug on the flow: 

   <ul>
   <pre><code>
   A. What is the output value of <strong>GreaterThanEquals</strong> Actor? Is it different now? Why? 
   B. Which Stage has been executed - <strong>Stage 6</strong> or <strong>Stage 7</strong>? Why?
   C. Check the output of the <a href="/articles/13_LUDB_viewer_and_studio_debug_capabilities/02_fabric_studio_log_files.md">Fabric Log File</a>.
      Which message is given by the <strong>Logger</strong> Actor? What is the level of the message? Is it different now? Why? 
   </code></pre>
   </ul>



### ![](/academy/images/Solution.png)Solution - Add a Condition to a Broadway Flow Exercise 

 <ul>
 <pre><code> 
 Step 5.1
 A. The output value of the <strong>Count</strong> Actor is 4. This is the number of the records returned by the <strong></strong>DbCommand</strong> Actor.
 B. The output value of <strong>GreaterThanEquals</strong> Actor is <strong>true</strong>.
 C. <strong>Stage 6</strong> has been executed since the condition returned <strong>true</strong>.
 D. The following messsage has been given by the Logger Actor of Stage 6: 
 <strong>INFO: There are 4 records in the list.</strong>
 </code></pre>
 </ul>

<ul>
<pre><code>
 Step 5.3
 A.The output value of <strong>GreaterThanEquals</strong> Actor is <strong>false</strong>.
 B.<strong>Stage 7</strong> has been executed since the condition returned <strong>false</strong>.
 C.The following messsage has been given by Stage 7's Logger Actor: 
     <strong>ERROR: Error- Error- there are not enough records in the list.</strong> 
     Stage 6 and Stage 7 Logger Actors have set different message levels since each has a different 
     value in the level input parameter.
 </code></pre>
 </ul>
