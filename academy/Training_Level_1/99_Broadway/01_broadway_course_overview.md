# Broadway Course Overview

Welcome to your first Broadway course!   

### Objectives

Our goal is to provide you with the information you need to kick-start your first Broadway flow while giving you the confidence needed to explore Broadway flow examples and the various built-in Actors provided by the Fabric Broadway ETL. 

In addition, you will also learn about how Broadway interfaces with Fabric and how to incorporate and execute Broadway flows into your Fabric project.

### Course Syllabus

Please go to the [Level 1 Broadway Training Syllabus](/academy/Training_Level_1/99_Broadway/02_broadway_training_syllabus.md).



### Course Prerequisites 

To fully understand this course, you should be familiar with the following principles, development languages and tools:

* K2view Fabric.

* Relational databases like MySQL and SQLite.

* Non-relational databases like Cassandra. 

* Java, JavaScript, SQL and CQL.

  

### Course Environment

Throughout the course, we will evolve within a Telco customer management environment that provides a set of DBs and tables that you will use to operate your first Fabric-based queries and data manipulations. 

This work environment features sets of tables  like customers, subscribers, invoices and contracts that you are already familiar with. 

The Broadway exercises are based on the [Demo Project](/articles/demo_project) in the K2view Academy repository.


To learn more about Fabric terminology at any time during the course, you are invited to checkout the [Fabric Glossary](/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md).
