### Different types of data manipulations

We will now look at the different types of functions that can be used to apply data manipulations on your Logical Unit tables.

Common to all these functions, you will find a set of built-in functions that can be used for any type of data transformation.

### Fabric functions

First of all let's understand the different types of project functions that can be developed and used by reading through this article: [Project Functions](articles/07_table_population/08_project_functions.md).



- [LUDB functions](articles/07_table_population/09_creating_an_LUDB_function.md) that can be invoked from within an SQL query.
- [Project functions](articles/07_table_population/10_creating_a_project_function.md) added to the project implementation to perform complex data manipulations or to execute queries on a specific instance.



### Root functions

- [Creating a root function](articles/07_table_population/11_1_creating_or_editing_a_root_function.md)
- [Examples of root functions and code example](articles/07_table_population/11_2_root_functions_code_examples)





### Decision functions
