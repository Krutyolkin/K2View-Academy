# Logical Units Enhancements

You are now ready to move on and to learn about a crucial Fabric feature, data manipulation and executing functions over the data that will be modified and exposed. So far you have seen how to design and create a simple LU by connecting to the data's external sources from which it is inferred, and testing its consistency by querying its tables using Fabric commands and the Cassandra storage environment and checking whether it is fit for purpose. 

 

### What Will You Experience In This Learning Item?

By the end of the Fabric Enhancement learning item you will know:

- How to create tables population mapping
- How to create populations
- How to write and execute root & DB functions 
- How to write and execute Enrichment & Decision functions
- How to use lookup and translations tables
- Establish efficient synchronization strategies with external sources

 

Let's start !
