# Fabric Runtime Overview



Reminder: Fabric consists of two separate layers:

- Implementation Layer (Studio): where the design, development, definition of tables, transformation rules and deployment are performed.
- Execution Layer (Server): where the actual migration and synchronization of data from source systems into  Fabric is performed.



Explain how the rules and logic created as part of your project implementation are deployed to the Execution layer while data is stored, accessed and queried on demand.
