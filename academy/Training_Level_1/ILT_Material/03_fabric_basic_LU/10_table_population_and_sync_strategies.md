Raise following questions:

- Do you have all the data you need? Does it need to be manipulated? 
- How can you make sure that the Customer LU’s data is always updated? 

### Table Population 


LU tables invoke a **Table Population** component, which is by default, the DB query that selects the data from its source. 

Present:

-  [Table Population Overview](/articles/07_table_population/01_table_population_overview.md)

- [Population Types and Comparison Analysis](/articles/07_table_population/02_source_object_types.md)

  

Introduce difference between DB query or a Java **Root function**, let’s see how to create one. 

Present:
- [Create New Table Population](/articles/07_table_population/03_creating_a_new_table_population.md)

- [Debug Table Population](/articles/13_LUDB_viewer_and_studio_debug_capabilities/03_debug_table_population.md) 



How to adjust or manipulate the extracted data depending on business requirements ?
How can your Call Centre continue to see the most accurate data? 



### Fabric Sync Concept

Present:

-  [Sync LUI Overview](/articles/14_sync_LU_instance/01_sync_LUI_overview.md).
