# Course Overview

Welcome to your first Fabric course!  



### Objectives

Our goal is to provide you with the information you need to kick-start your first project while giving you the confidence to explore the many data transformation development tools provided by the Fabric framework. 

As you know, Big Data systems can be overwhelming from both data quantity and data quality perspectives. 

Once you understand how to use Fabric, you will know how to connect to multiple data source types and formats of any size, type of structure, whether legacy or real-time systems. 

You will then learn how to manipulate the data you are sourcing into your Fabric environment, how to create new data relationships and generate the unique value-added information you could not harness beforehand. 

Once this is done, you will be shown how to expose this data through a set of customized APIs to external parties like your colleagues, customers and partners.



### Course Syllabus

The level 1 training syllabus can be consulted [here](/academy/Training_Level_1/01_Fabric_Introduction/1_2_training_level_1_syllabus.md).



### Course Pre-requisites 

To fully understand this course, you should be familiar with the following principles, development languages and tools:

* Relational databases, such as MySQL and SQLite.

* Non-relational databases, such as Cassandra. 

* Java, SQL and CQL.

* Git or other version control tools.

 

### Course Environment

Throughout the course, we will evolve within a Telco customer management environment that provides a set of DBs and tables that you will use to operate your first Fabric-based queries and data manipulations. 

This work environment will feature sets of tables that you are already familiar with, such as customers, subscribers, invoices and contracts. Of course, we will need you to get acquainted with these tables and Databases, as we will be operating multiple data manipulations across the various examples and exercises that illustrate this course.

At any time, to get acquainted with Fabric terminology, you should consult the [Fabric's Glossary](/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md).
