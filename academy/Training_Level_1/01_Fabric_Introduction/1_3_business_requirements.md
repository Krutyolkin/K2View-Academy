# Training Business Requirements

![](/academy/Training_Level_1/01_Fabric_Introduction/images/businessReq.png)

During this training course, we will evolve within a telco environment that provides the following Databases:

- CRM 
- Billing
- Orders
- Collection

You will be seeing various information about customers such as their private details, contracts, payments and invoices. But we will come back and explore the content of these Databases in the Interfaces section.

The idea of the course is to provide you with the environment necessary to explore and manipulate data with Fabric, i.e. by enabling the creation of what we call Digital Entities and applying transformations on their respective Logical Units types.

In this course, we will learn how to create such a digital entity with a 360 degree view of any data sitting on all records and pertaining specifically to that very entity. 

We will then apply data transformations techniques to enrich and extract added-value information to the one already observable through the 360 peripherical view Fabric provides.

We will also learn how to present this data to whoever needs to access it, thanks to web-services or queue messages services specifically designed to expose the data in any format (web for example). 

 

We can easily imagine customers receiving this link by email while the web-service redirect them to the summary of their details.

Along the course we will assume the following roles within the Telco environment:

- A customer eager to receive a list of the services to which he subscribes, or a summary of his details and of the last invoices or active balances
- A customer support operator needing to retrieve all these details as fast and as accurately as possible
- A business analyst that needs to operate the necessary data transformations to help him design new offers or get new insights on the companyâ€™s products, services or customers (or any combination of these for the matter)
