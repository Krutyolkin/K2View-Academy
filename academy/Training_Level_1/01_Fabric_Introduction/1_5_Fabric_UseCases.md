# Fabric Use Cases



Now that you understand what Fabric is and what you will gain from its usage once you will harness our technology, we would like to share with you what our customers achieved when they streamlined Fabric within their complex business flows:

 

**Use Case 1 - Wireless companies’ merger**

After a multi-billion North American wireless company acquired two of its competitors, they had to combine the two acquired systems with their own. By leveraging K2View Fabric and its patented use of micro-databases, the company was able to deliver full Customer 360 access and control including:

\-      Integrated data across three separate companies in only three weeks

\-      A customer data hub supporting 15 million customers across 1,000 locations

\-     Multi-million USD savings in infrastructure and manual work

 

*It took just three weeks to implement the K2View Fabric solution, which gave the wireless company a single source of data and allowed it to meet the government’s requirements and deadline for the merger.* 

*Customer-facing applications were integrated directly into K2View Fabric, reducing the data latency from minutes to milliseconds. The implementation and its deployment had zero impact on legacy systems operations, and the company reports 100 percent availability of customer data since deployment.*

 

**Use Case 2 - Entertainment Customer experience**

A global media and entertainment brand needed to improve its poor customer experience due to it relied upon multiple systems across multiple countries, caused significant latency issues in accessing the company’s customer data. Implementing K2View Fabric enabled the company to integrate their customer data into a single platform and create a Customer 360 view for over one million customers, resulting in:

\-      Integrated data from multiple countries and systems in just three days

\-      A faster customer self-service experience and increased customer satisfaction

\-      An on-going cost reduction of multi-million annually Multiple Data Sources due to disappointing user experience and lack of adoption of the portal by the company’s one million customers. 

*After deciding to implement K2View Fabric, it took just three days to the company’s implementors to integrate data from residing across multiple countries and systems, thus giving a Customer 360 view and real-time synchronization of data upon changes. This was achieved with no impact on legacy systems. Furthermore, data latency from core systems was cut from minutes to milliseconds, improving the customer self-service experience and cutting costs.* 

 

 

Now we have seen how Fabric helps our customers across different industries, and how significant savings are generated within days, it is time we started learning about Fabric architecture and more specifically how data flows between 3rd party systems (providing and consuming data) and Fabric:
