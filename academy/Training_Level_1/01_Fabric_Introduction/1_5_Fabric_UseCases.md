# Fabric Use Cases



Now that you understand what Fabric is and what you will gain from its usage once you will harness our technology, we would like to share with you what our customers achieved when they streamlined Fabric within their complex business flows:

 

**Use Case 1 - Wireless companies’ merger**

After a multi-billion North American wireless company acquired two of its competitors, they had to combine the two acquired systems with their own. By leveraging K2View Fabric and its patented use of micro-databases, the company was able to deliver full Customer 360 access and control including:

\-      Integrated data across three separate companies in only three weeks

\-      A customer data hub supporting 15 million customers across 1,000 locations

\-     Multi-million USD savings in infrastructure and manual work

 

*It took just three weeks to implement the K2View Fabric solution, which gave the wireless company a single source of data and allowed it to meet the government’s requirements and deadline for the merger.* 

*Customer-facing applications were integrated directly into K2View Fabric, reducing the data latency from minutes to milliseconds. The implementation and its deployment had zero impact on legacy systems operations, and the company reports 100 percent availability of customer data since deployment.*

 

**Use Case 2 - 360 Network Monitoring**

A global network services provider needed to improve its customer experience by anticipating customer's issues across multiple states. The company's servers would receive automatically generated tickets from the alerts raised by the network equipment installed at the customer's homes (such as outage, performance, usage data).  Implementing K2View Fabric enabled the company to integrate their customer data with their equipment network topology into a single platform and create a Network 360 view for millions customers, and thousands of concurrent alarms, resulting in:

\-     Real-time aggregation of alarms to identify issues before the customer notices, and to reduce significantly customer calls,

\-     Real-time correlation between network events and impacted customers to ensure proactive communication with callers 

\-      Efficient deflection of customer calls towards the matching handling team, message, or house-call field operative,

\-     Cutting significantly AHT by ensuring consolidated customer360

\-     Proactive identification of area power or network outages
