# Fabric Use Cases



Now that you understand what Fabric is and what you will gain from its usage once you will harness our technology, we would like to share with you what our customers achieved when they streamlined Fabric within their complex business flows:

 

**Use Case 1 - Wireless companies’ merger**

After a multi-billion North American wireless company acquired two of its competitors, they had to combine the two acquired systems with their own. By leveraging K2View Fabric and its patented use of micro-databases, the company was able to deliver full Customer 360 access and control including:

\-      Integrated data across three separate companies in only three weeks

\-      A customer data hub supporting 15 million customers across 1,000 locations

\-     Multi-million USD savings in infrastructure and manual work

 

*It took just three weeks to implement the K2View Fabric solution, which gave the wireless company a single source of data and allowed it to meet the government’s requirements and deadline for the merger.* 

*Customer-facing applications were integrated directly into K2View Fabric, reducing the data latency from minutes to milliseconds. The implementation and its deployment had zero impact on legacy systems operations, and the company reports 100 percent availability of customer data since deployment.*

 

**Use Case 2 - 360 Network Monitoring**

A global network services provider needed to improve its customer experience by anticipating customer's issues across multiple states. The company's systems automatically receive  tickets generated from the alerts raised by the network equipment installed at their customer's premises (such as outage, performance, usage data).  

Implementing K2View Fabric enabled the company to integrate their customer data with their equipment network topology records into a single platform and create a Network 360 view for millions of customers and thousands of concurrent alarms (100 thousand per day across the park). 

This resulted in:

\-     providing real-time aggregation of alarms and identification of issues before the customer even notices any issue, thus reducing significantly support calls

\-     ensuring real-time correlation between network events, impacted customers and spatial occurrences to enable proactive communication and swift resolution of issues

\-     Efficient deflection of customer calls towards the matching handling team, message, or field operatives

\-     Cutting significantly AHT by ensuring consolidated customer360

\-     Proactive discovery and identification of new types of outages
