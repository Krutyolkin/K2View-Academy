Excellent! you have completed the Fabric Overview and Architecture learning items.

 

Before moving to the next item, you can test what you've learned by taking the following quiz. It consists of a number of multiple-choice questions, each providing a number of possible answers. Select the answer you think is correct by clicking it:



#### Question 1: Fabric Overview

Working with Fabric will allow you to:

\-     A: Get fast answers to complex questions across data-lakes such as across-the-board statistics or BI insights.

\-     B: Answer to a complex question about one or multiple customers in real-time, although data might be spread across multiple data centers.

\-     C: Securely store data.

 

#### Question 2: Fabric concepts

Logical Units are:

\-     A: Hierarchical presentations of data related to a defined business entity, that need to be carefully designed according to a specific set of business requirements.

\-     B: Blocks of code queries designed to extract information from a DB.  

\-     C: A data mapping tool that extracts information from data warehouses.

\-     D: A data publishing service for external. 

\-     E: All the above.

 

#### Question 3: Fabric usage

You will use Fabric when you need to:

\-     A: Be able to ask any question on a business entity (e.g. a customer), even if its data resides on tens or hundreds of applications.

\-     B: Get up-to-date data.

\-     C: Get an answer is milliseconds. 

\-     D: Use SQL for complex queries on entities usually residing across multiple DBs and servers.

\-     E: Have data available and secured at all times.

\-     G: All the above.

 

#### Question 4: Fabric product

Fabric is:

\-     A: A schema builder that can create co-relational logic between multiple entities originating from multiple tables, databases or data source types.

\-     B: A powerful ETL engine that allows you to connect to remote DBs and execute complex data queries. 

\-     C: A development engine that allows you to write enrichment functions and execute them on your schema.

\-     D: A resilient, multi-tenant web-service publishing engine. 

\-     E: All the above.



#### Question 5: Fabric Storage

Fabric enables all data retrieved from external sources to be stored as:

\-     A: A single Logical Entity on a dedicated PostgreSQL database, residing on a single node server to increase access speed and reduce network latency.

\-     B: As multiple digital entities, each one stored as an SQLite micro-database on Cassandra distributed nodes.

\-     C: As a digital unit stored as a binary file pointing to different DBs distributed across external networks.

 

#### Question 6: Fabric Storage

To store its data, Fabric uses the following storage mechanism:

\-     Storage on files using RAID.

\-     Oracle database storage.

\-     Distributed storage as a key value-store.

\-     No physical storage. Everything resides in memory.

 

#### Question 7: Data security

Fabric uses data from multiple external sources. To ensure the integrity of the data you fetch, store and generate, Fabric provides:

\-     A: Strong authorization and authentication to protect systems from incoming requests when exposing the data as web-services. 

\-     B: Data masking to hide real data during development or QA phases.

\-     C: Encryption of all micro-databases (LUI) created at any time.

\-     D: Encryption of part of an LUI according to specifications provided by the LU designer. 

\-     E: All the above.

 

#### Question 8: Fabric as a Data Flow Management System

Implementers can use Fabric to define and run:

\-     A: Complete flows of data manipulations such as data inserts directly into targets (LUIs).

\-     B: Schedule jobs that will be executed according to pre-defined rules or schedules.

\-     C: Parse data from any type of data source and store it in SQL tables.

\-     D: Write java functions to operate data transformations or trigger synchronizations.

\-     E: All the above and more. 

 

#### Question 9: Fabric functions

 In Fabric you can create functions that can be used as: 

\-     The root of population maps.

\-     New SQL query functions.

\-     Web-Services.

\-     All the above.
