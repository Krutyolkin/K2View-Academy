# CDC Implementation and Configuration

Now you are familiar with CDC process and the CDC messages, you are ready to learn how you can add CDC fields to the LU tables and how to configure your Fabric to work with the CDC consumers.

### What Will You Experience In This Learning Item?

By the end of this learning item you will:

- Know how to add CDC consumers to the Fabric project.
- Know how to add CDC fields to the LU tables.
- Know how to configure Fabric to enable the CDC process.
- Check the CDC messages, published for the CDC fields.

### CDC Implementation

The CDC implementation consists of two steps:

1. Adding CDC consumers to the k2proj file of the Fabric project.
2. Adding CDC fields on selected LU tables' columns.

Read [CDC Implementation Steps](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/03_cdc_consumers_implementation.md) to learn more about how to add a CDC implementation to the Fabric project.

### CDC Configuration

Read [CDC Configuration](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/06_cdc_configuration.md) to learn how to configure Fabric [config.ini file](/articles/02_fabric_architecture/05_fabric_main_configuration_files.md#configini) to support the CDC.
