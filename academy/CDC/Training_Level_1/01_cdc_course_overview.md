# Fabric CDC Course Overview

**Welcome to your first Fabric CDC course!**   



### Objectives

This course provides you with the information about the Fabric Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanism and enable you to add CDC fields to your Fabric implementation. 

In addition, you will also learn about the CDC consumers, and the built-in integration of Fabric with the Elasticsearch, which enables a cross instance search.

### Course Syllabus

Please go to the [Level 1 CDC Training Syllabus](02_cdc_training_syllabus.md).



### Course Prerequisites 

To fully understand this course, you should be familiar with the following principles, development languages and tools:

* K2view Fabric.

### Course Environment

Throughout the course, we will evolve within a Telco customer management environment that provides a set of DBs and tables that you will use to operate your first Fabric-based queries and data manipulations. 

This work environment features sets of tables  like customers, subscribers, invoices and contracts that you are already familiar with. 

In addition you need to install Kafka, Zookeeper, and Elasticsearch on your local working station. 

[Click for the installation instructions](/articles/demo_project/01_local_installation_of_zookeper_kafka_and_ES.md).

The CDC and Search exercises are based on the [Demo Project](/articles/demo_project) in the K2view Academy repository.


To learn more about Fabric terminology at any time during the course, you are invited to checkout the [Fabric Glossary](/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md).


But first, letâ€™s understand more about the CDC.
