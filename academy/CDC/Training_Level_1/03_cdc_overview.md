# CDC Overview

**Welcome to the first section of this course!**

### What Will You Experience In This Learning Item?

By the end of the Change Data Capture (CDC) Introduction learning item you will know:

- What CDC is.
- CDC high level flow.
- CDC messages and publication flow.

To get started with CDC, please read the [CDC Overview](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/01_change_data_capture_overview.md).

### CDC Publication Flow

In general, Fabric publishes CDC messages upon the update of the LU schema or the LUI data.

Read the [CDC Publication Flow](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/04_cdc_publication_flow.md) to learn which scenarios trigger a publication of CDC messages and what are the different types of the CDC messages.

Read the [CDC Messages](/articles/18_fabric_cdc/02_cdc_messages.md) to have a better understanding about the different types of the CDC messages and view examples of each message type.

Read [CDC Process Architecture](articles/18_fabric_cdc/05_cdc_process_architecture.md) to have a better understanding of the CDC flow.

Now when you have  better understanding of the CDC process, lets start how to define CDC fields in the Fabric project.
