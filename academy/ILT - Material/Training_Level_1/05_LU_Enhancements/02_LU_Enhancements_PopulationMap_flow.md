#   LU Populations Flow

 

### Different types of data manipulations

NTT -> Look at what needs to be considered to ensure that the LU data from external systems is processed efficiently: 

NTT -> Questions for audience:

- What changes would I want to apply to the data?

  - Cosmetic change to ensure format compliancy across the flow.
  - Mathematical formulas to compute new data. 
  - Conversion rules. 

- How to create new fields or tables by receiving transformed input from multiple fields within the schema and by applying transformation functions.

- How I ensure data is up-to-date by enforcing synchronization of specific LUIs.

  

NTT -> Apply data transformations using the following available objects:

- Functions
- Translations
- Globals
- Lookup tables

Present: 
[Populations Diagrams Outline](/articles/07_table_population/12_table_population_diagram_outline.md) article. 

NTT -> Mention [Execution Orders](/articles/07_table_population/13_LU_table_population_execution_order.md) to understand how to set different execution orders for the population objects you defined above.
